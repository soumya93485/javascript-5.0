##What is javascript and why used it?

-javascript is logic based programing language where we can ctreate our code project functionality in that.
-javascript is a high level programming language for build web pages.
-Now we used the ES6(echma script 6) version of javascript,in other words we called vanila javascript.
-runtime environment of javascript is node js.

##Variable:-
 
 -variable is container to store some data.
 -in javascript we have 3 types of variables:-
 1.let :-
    -Let is a type of variable which is used for changing the variable name later.
    -Now these days , most of the cases we used let for creating variables.
    -Let is a block scope code so we have been using let for most of the cases.
 2.var :-
    -Var is a type of variable which is also used for changing the variable later stage.
    -Var is used in oldest browser so now a days we are don't use var most of the time.
 3.const :-
    -Const is a type of variable where we can't change our data further.
    -const means constant to sote some data like numbers,intiger etc...

    task :-
    1.difference between let & var.
    2.difference between var & const.
    3.what do you mean by haisting.(when we don't declare value of variable but it execute the code)
